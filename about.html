			<p> About Me </p>
		</div>

		<p> Hello! I am Autumn Percy, the writer and creator of <i>News on the Neuse</i>. I am a freshman at Fuquay-Varina High School,
			and I am fifteen years old. I am working on many projects, and you can find out about them here! </p>

			<p> Capable Yet Large Computer </p>
		</div>

		<p> The Capable Yet Large Computer (CYLC, pronounced silk) is a computer that I am working on. I am first using breadboards to
			create a model of the first version, then improving it, and then it will be on PCB. 
			<br>
			I am in the planning stages of CYLC, and I have ordered the first parts.</p>

			<p> A Short History of Languages </p>
		</div>

		<p> A Short History of Languages is a video series I have been working on making. I have only begun to write the first script for the
			Germanic langauges. I will begin with the Proto-Germanic language and then discuss the evolution from there to each living 
			Germanic language. </p>
		
		<div class="DivZero">
			<p> Language Learning </p>
		</div>
		
		<p> I am learning German and Finnish mostly, however I sometimes will dabble in Swedish, Danish, Georgian, French, and other
			languages. </p>
