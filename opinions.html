		<p> <br><br>Hello and welcome to the Opinions page, where I give my opinions about different topics! </p>

			<p> On Pandora Holmes </p>
		</div>
		
		<p> <br>Pandora Holmes, a transgender woman, was lied to by the NHS, the British National Health Service. She was told that she had a prescription to pick up. Instead, she was taken, forced into a hospital, and then forced to stay for 48 hours. It was said to be only two days, but they eventually extended her stay, despite her not being a danger to herself or anyone else. She is not given her HRT during this time. After speaking out on Discord, a social media site, and creating a video, the hospital staff took away her food and water. She is going through hormonal changes against her will due to the lack of HRT. In her third video, she tells that she has not been given food for three days and only a bare minimum of fluids to live.<br><br>To recap, we have a transgender prisoner who is being forcibly detransitioned by the health service of the United Kingdom and being tortured. On June 11th, she is sent to Highbury Hospital, with the staff at Sherwood Oaks giving her transphobic verbal abuse. The police had to tell the NHS to put her in the correct ward, instead of a men's ward where she would likely be sexually abused. On June 13th, with her ninth video, Pandora says that she is being sleep deprived. All this time, the NHS has been wanting to hold her for six months in the inhumane conditions that Pandora reports. After enough campaigning, she was given treatment for her gender dysphoria after ten days of torture. Pandora is almost certainly not the first to witness torture by the NHS for their gender identity, and I highly recommend you read the Reddit post that gives all of the information about her.<br><br></p>

		<p> The torture of Pandora Holmes should never have happened, and it should never happen again. The fact that anyone in any country has gotten away with torturing transgender people like Pandora is a stain on humanity's record. Nations such as the United Kingdom and the United States have recently had a major wave of anti-transgender sentiment. Hate against trans people eventually leads to this. Don't let this torture happen again. </p>
