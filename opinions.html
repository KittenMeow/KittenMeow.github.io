		<p> <em>Part Zero: What is Weird?</em><br>Hello, I am Autumn, and I'm weird. <q>Weird</q> is a word that has negative connotations.
				When we say weird, we think of it as meaning something that is unusual or unfamiliar to us. We would find a quiet kid suddenly
				slapping someone out of nowhere weird. We rarely find <q>being weird</q> as a good thing.

				I would argue that being weird is a good thing. When something is unfamiliar or abnormal, that does not have to be bad. In
				fact, it is a good thing. That is why I would like to be weird. To explain why, I would like to talk about familiarity.
			<br><br>
			<em>Part One: Familiarity</em><br>When something is familiar, it is something that has happened before. For the average American,
			the internet is familiar. 95% of Americans have access to it, according to a Pew Resaearch survey. A vast majority of us find
			the internet to be a part of every day life. Meanwhile, what is unfamiliar? Something that is unfamiliar may have happened before,
			but it may not be something that we know as much about. For example, a Digital 2023 report tells us that just under 14% of
			Cameroon uses social media. This fact means that social media is a rather unfamiliar thing to Cameroonians. Unfamiliarity means
			that people new to social media often have a harder time using it. That's okay, people new to social media can learn to use it.
			<br>
			Since being weird often means being unfamiliar with something, many people in Cameroon who have had little exposure to social
			media may find it weird. That doesn't mean that they find it bad, they just find it different. If they were to be exposed to it,
			they might even find it to be a good thing. It lets you connect worldwide and share what is happening. 
			<br>
			However, we can also find people weird. This is a somewhat different concept. If you don't know someone, they're not weird. It's
			just that you don't know them. Often, when we describe someone as weird, we actually mean their personality is weird. As we've 
			seen, being weird isn't about being bad. Americans don't find social media good or bad because it's familiar or weird. Being weird
			in the case of personality traits is often considered bad, but it really isn't. 
			<br><br>
			<em>Part Two: Personality</em><br>I would say that different personality traits, ones that are <q>abnormal</q> are actually good.
			They can give us insight into a new life and ideas, possibly ideas better than what we already have. Let's take a <q>weird</q>
			personality trait. Many people would consider punk to be unfamiliar to them. However, if we look at the punk subculture, we can
			find many good ideas. The anti-authoritarianism, being against corporate greed, and DIY ideas are good things. However, people
			who don't learn about the punk subculture often consider it to be very <q>weird</q> and even to be a bad thing, because they
			do not learn what it is about.
			<br><br>
			<em>Part Three: Conclusion</em><br>The conclusion is this: weirdness can expose us to new ideas, and possibly better ideas.
