      <p>
              Can you hear the bleeding?<br>
              Can you feel the screaming?<br>
              They want out of containment.<br>
              Torture isn't valid payment.<br><br>

              Young people are driven here,<br>
              Through a system that puts them here.<br>
              It's not their fault to fight,<br>
              They have been denied life.<br><br>

              No one should be left alone like this.<br>
              Do you know what happens here?<br>
              Violence breeds more violence,<br>
              Don't you know that this is what that is?<br><br>

              Young people are driven here,<br>
              They haven't learned what peace is.<br>
              It's not their fault to fight,<br>
              And you made them angrier.<br><br>
    </p>

        <p>
                I feel the heart rotting in my chest.<br>
                The stains and bandages across it,<br>
                Seem to read my name, and they say:<br><br>

                “There's no coming back from this illness,<br>
                Your heart will degrade forever.<br>
                Everything you want to love,<br>
                Is so far out of reach you'll hate it.”<br><br>

                Ten lifetimes of torture,<br>
                Ten lifetimes of waiting,<br>
                Ten lifetimes of violence,<br>
                This is how murderers are made.<br><br>

                <br>I've gotten my lifetime's worth.<br>
                This fucking movie is old news,<br>
                But now I have to continue.<br>
                What is in the heart of these others?<br>
                Love, peace, and fucking happiness?<br>
                That's what I was sold on,<br>
                But it's so clearly false advertising.<br><br>

                I feel like all I can do in this film,<br>
                Is what I've always gotten.<br>
                Ten lifetimes worth of uselessness,<br>
                And ten lifetimes worth of violence.<br><br>

                This movie is old news now,<br>
                And I thought it would be over.<br>
                What kind of film has no end?<br>
                What kind of film does the protagonist<br>
                Keep getting shot over and over?<br><br>

                It won't be this film, I'll tell you.<br><br>

                <br>I've gotten my lifetime's worth.<br>
                This fucking movie is old news,<br>
                But now I have to continue.<br>
                What is in the heart of these others?<br>
                Love, peace, and fucking happiness?<br>
                That's what I was sold on,<br>
                But it's so clearly false advertising.<br><br>

                Now I have to continue.<br>
                Don't you understand this?<br>
                It's how murderers are made.<br>
                Do you fucking want this?<br><br>

                This protagonist is about ready to flip,<br>
                I won't accept being the victim.<br>
                All life has handed me is torture,<br>
                Do you want me to be the antagonist?<br><br>

                <br>I've gotten my lifetime's worth.<br>
                This fucking movie is old news,<br>
                But now I have to continue.<br>
                What is in the heart of these others?<br>
                Love, peace, and fucking happiness?<br>
                That's what I was sold on,<br>
                But it's so clearly false advertising.<br><br>

                <br>I've gotten my lifetime's worth.<br>

        <p>Again, again!<br>
        Again, again!<br>
        Again, again, again, again!<br><br>

        I feel like the times are coming back,<br>
        Repeating themselves in such a way<br>
        That terrifies me!<br><br>

        Pieces of everyone I knew<br>
        Return in every field of vision.<br>
        No one can see it! <br><br>

        The rapids of this bleeding river <br>
        Feel like they're gonna fall,<br>
        And then that will be all.<br><br>

        This play is serendipity in reverse,<br>
        All according to plan, let's rehearse.<br>
        I just know that the final product<br>
        Will be the game to end it all!<br><br>

        <br>Again, again!<br>
        Again, again!<br>
        Again, again, again, again!<br><br>

        Silence! The followers are speaking.<br>
        The saviour has returned to torture us,<br>
        Freeing us from the depths of free will.<br><br>

        <br>Again, again!<br>
        Again, again!<br>
        Again, again, again, again!<br><br>

        Fallacious arguments about fallacies,<br>
        “It won't return that way, it can't be true.”<br>
        All I see is you denying reality!<br><br>

        Peace will never break into my mind,<br>
        And love will never enter my vena cava!<br>
        See the timeline!<br><br>

        Do I make myself clear enough,<br>
        When I tell you I'm not getting better?<br>
        Cede the timeline!<br><br>

        This play is serendipity in reverse,<br>
        All according to plan, let's rehearse.<br>
        I just know that the final product<br>
        Will be the game to end it all!<br><br>

        <br>Again, again!<br>
        Again, again!<br>
        Again, again, again, again!<br><br>

        <br>Again, again!<br>
        Again, again!<br>
        Again, again, again, again!<br><br>

        Hope will never enter my brain,<br>
        And love will never enter my vena cava!<br><br>
